# Hands-On ML using Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow
These notebooks implement the code in each chapter for learning purposes.
<br>Also recreated some extra diagrams, whose code isn't shown in its chapter.
<br>Some notes/summaries are also added in the notebooks.

## Purpose
- To bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.
- To learn about more uses of traditional ML approaches and DL approaches.
- To know best practices and reasonable default choices in the field.
- To know about better ways to train, evaluate and deploy models, at scale.
